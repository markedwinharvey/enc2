`enc2` (`encryptor2`) is an encryption/decryption script for python 2.7. 

The program implements a substitution/permutation network on a target file. 

Folders containing multiple files can be encrypted; the folder and its files are first serialized. 

The first 100 characters of the new document generated at each iteration is displayed. 

Decryption reverses the substitution-permutation network steps to provide the original file or folder.
